# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest published release and the `main` branch — where development takes place — are considered currently supported code.

We only support the latest published, stable Joomla version in the 3.x and 4.0 version ranges. We do not support
Joomla alphas, betas or release candidates (testing releases). If a security issue only occurs with a testing
release we will consider it but we cannot promise a rapid resolution.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **DO NOT** file a GitHub issue in the clear about security issues. GitHub issues are public.
Filing an issue about a security issue puts all users, you included, in immediate danger.

Please use [this page](https://keybase.io/encrypt) to encrypt your message with my GPG key and send
it to me via the [contact form on my site](https://lucid-fox.com/contact).

Please include instructions to reproduce the security issue. Better yet, please include Proof
Of Concept code if applicable.

## Expected timeframe

We aim to reply within a business week (5 working days excluding bank holidays). We request a period
of 60 to 90 calendar days from the time we receive adequate information to reproduce the issue before
public disclosure so we have time to address the security issue, publish a new version and make sure
everyone is updated.

## Bug bounty and CVEs

As a very small business we do not have the resources to support a bug bounty program. We are also too
small to be a CVE issuing authority.

We appreciate the time you put into security research and the time you spend contacting small businesses
like ours with your findings. We will publicly acknowledge your security report and credit you with your
discovery when making our release. You will have our and our users' gratitude for your hard work!
