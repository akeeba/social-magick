<h3>What's new?</h3>

<p>
	We started working on SocialMagick 3.0 from the ground up. Our focus has been ease of use, elimination of all bugs and annoying quirks, and coming up with a much improved interface and brand-new features.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>A component to manage your templates</strong>. Gone are the days of endless scrolling through the plugin options, struggling to find the correct settings for each template. SocialMagick 3.0 introduces a component to manage your templates.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Preview template</strong>. You can now preview how your OpenGraph template will render different images and text before you save your changes. No more guessing!
</p>

<p>
	<strong>New OpenGraph Preview in the frontend</strong>. SocialMagick 3.0 introduces a new OpenGraph preview in the frontend. A hovering button appears in the bottom right corner of your screen. Click on it to see a preview of your page's social media share link using the OpenGraph data added to the page by the plugin.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Correct cascading of the options</strong>. The built-in defaults are overriden by the options set in the component's options, which are overridden by the options set in the categories (with correct cascading across children categories), which are overridden by the options set in the article, which are overridden by the options set in the menu item. This is the same way Joomla works for cascading display options in com_content (Articles and Categories).
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Image sources with fallbacks</strong>. You can choose to pull the Extra Image for the OpenGraph image template from the article's intro image, the article's full-text image, or a custom field â€“ exclusively, or as a fallback to each other in any combination and order you want. For categories, you can choose between the category's image, and a custom field, exclusively or as a fallback to each other in any order you want.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Image effects</strong>. You can now apply opacity, grayscale, and sepia effects to the base and extra image used for compositing the OpenGraph image. This gives you an unprecedented level of artistic control over the final image.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Text stroke</strong>. You can now add a text stroke (outline) of a color and width of your choice to the text overlaid on the OpenGraph image.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Text opacity</strong>. You can now define the opacity (transparency) of the text overlaid on the OpenGraph image.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>ImageMagick: Show ellipses when text is being truncated</strong>. When text overlaid on an OpenGraph image is being truncated, the ellipses are now shown regardless of whether you use the ImageMagick or the GD library.
